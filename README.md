# DBL-Data-Challenge-Group23

Thefirst data challenge revolves around the question of how you compare the performance of Airlines when they use Twitter as a communication channel. The dataset you will be analyzing consists of a large number of tweets from some airlines, and you will be asked, in a role-playing game, to analyze the data for one of your clients. Your client is KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines), and in this course, KLM is interested in assessing their performance when using Twitter as a communication channel. They are generally interested in comparing their performance to other airlines in general and British Airways in particular. KLM will be represented by A KLM marketeer. The marketeer wonders whether his Twitter team (which tries to respond quickly to incoming tweets) is doing a good job and whether this is useful for the company, particularly in comparison to the British Airways.
